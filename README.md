## mIRCAutoDL
##### AutoDL program for mIRC
---
**Edit:**
Sorry for the delay, I was sick the past couple days and weekend.  The alpha will be out this weekend
regardless of the hours required! I realized when coming back that I wasn't hitting the mark on some
of my extensibility goals, and could generally structure the program more flexibly.  After today's major
update, I'm going to work on testing and fixing immediate bugs and/or issues, then release with a simple
batch installer.  My immediate goal after that is to work on my external WPF GUI and a Wix# installer for beta!

Used to manage a download queue for (currently only) mIRC with various quality-of-life improvements!
The old version is available as the stable v1.0.0 release [here](https://github.com/Rinsho/mIRCAutoDL/releases).
The new version will be in alpha soonâ„¢.  It is compilable, I just need to work on a couple more things!
More information is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Rinsho/mIRCAutoDL/wiki).

If you're here just to look at the code, here's a simple diagram that shows how the components interact.
Hopefully it helps understand the program flow ;D
