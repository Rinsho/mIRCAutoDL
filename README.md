## mIRCAutoDL
##### AutoDL program for mIRC
---
**Update:**
Going to do some final testing tomorrow, but it looks like we're go for alpha!  Fixed all the bugs I have encountered so far and added additional functionality.  Proposed Alpha Build was uploaded today!

Used to manage a download queue for (currently only) mIRC with various quality-of-life improvements!
The old version is available as the stable v1.0.0 release [here](https://github.com/Rinsho/mIRCAutoDL/releases).
The new version will be in alpha soonâ„¢.  More information is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Rinsho/mIRCAutoDL/wiki).

If you're here just to look at the code, here's a simple diagram that shows how the components interact.
Hopefully it helps understand the program flow ;D
