## mIRCAutoDL
##### AutoDL program for mIRC

**Edit2:**
Status update:  There's an odd bug in the release build I'm having trouble replicating in my debug build.  Gonna take an extra day trying to work it out.  If I can't I'll just turn optimization options off for now and go ahead with alpha.

**Edit:**
Hey! Update today fixing all the bugs my test suite could find. Once I confirm my installer works and take the program through some rounds on my box I'll be updating the Wiki and releasing alpha!  My immediate goal after that is to update the program comments (they're outdated to a previous build) then work on my external WPF GUI and a Wix# installer for beta!

Used to manage a download queue for (currently only) mIRC with various quality-of-life improvements!
The old version is available as the stable v1.0.0 release [here](https://github.com/Rinsho/mIRCAutoDL/releases).
The new version will be in alpha soonâ„¢.  More information is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Rinsho/mIRCAutoDL/wiki).

If you're here just to look at the code, here's a simple diagram that shows how the components interact.
Hopefully it helps understand the program flow ;D
